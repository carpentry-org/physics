# Physics

This is a Carp port of [phys.js](https://github.com/AbhiAgarwal/phys.js),
and serves as an example for the structure of a non-trivial external library
in Carp.

You’ll find the top level module at `physics.carp`. The individual,
thematically grouped submodules are found in `src`. The tests use the standard
Carp unit testing module and are located in `tests`. Happy reading!

PS: The library itself is also definitely usable, although I don’t claim to be
an expert in computational physics by any means.

Have fun!
