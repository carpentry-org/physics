# Physics

This is a Carp port of [phys.js](https://github.com/AbhiAgarwal/phys.js),
and serves as an example for the structure of an external library in Carp.

The port itself is done, but I will add test cases in `test/` to make this
a better example of what well-structured Carp modules could possibly look
like.

The library itself is also definitely usable, although I donâ€™t claim to be an
expert of computational physics by any means.

Have fun!
